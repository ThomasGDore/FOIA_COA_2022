## Excel Analysis of COA USPS requests

This is an analysis of COA (Change of Address) requests made to the USPS (United States Postal Service) during the year of 2022. 
In this analysis we attempt to answer two questions primarily, and we explore two questions secondarily. Namely: we are curious about the which zip codes had the most people moving to them, and which had the most moving away from them. After we answer these questions, we briefly explore the same format questions, but with regards to states.

This analysis could be useful to real-estate agents and business development analysts who are seeking where to expand to next.
